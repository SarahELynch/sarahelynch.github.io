This project involved creating 1) a chatbot and 2) a large-scale application for a demo, meant to be shown to potential clients in order to 'pull back the covers' a bit on how a chatbot created with IBM Watson Conversation Service (the service has since been renamed to Watson Assistant) works.

The idea was this:
If a client better understands the inner-workings of chatbots,
they will be better equipped to interact with them successfully, and, thus,
more likely to adopt Watson Conversation Service.


This demo application was to be shown in an experience center, on a "wall" of nine very large screens.
These types of applications are presented by an IBM-employed professional presenter, called an Experience Leader.

So, that gave us two types of users for this application:
A Potential Client (the app viewer - in other words, the audience)
An Experience Leader (the presenter & fearless leader)
